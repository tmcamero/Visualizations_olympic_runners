Information Visualization: Evolution of Olympic Runners from 1896 to 2016

Description

This project creates a poster answering the questions how have Olympic runners changed over time and what are the results of these changes.  The information provided about each athlete is their name, sex, age, height, weight, team, NOC, game, year, event, medals, and time results.

CSV files were created by converting the Kaggle data “120 Years of Olympic History Athletes and Results” and “Olympic Track & Field Results” into Excel files and filtering by event.

The visualizations were created in R and then exported to Adobe Illustrator for editing.
